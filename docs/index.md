Welcome to Serarif, my first typeface ever! This typeface was orignally designed just for fun, but now I decided to use it in my projects (which also helps me transition from monospace).

## Overview
Serarif is a sans-serif typeface. Each line has constant thickness and squared at the caps.

The typeface itself was made from simple shapes like rectangles and circles (ellipse on some glyphs like ``0`` or capital ``O``):
